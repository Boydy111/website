    <b id="title1">What is pixel art?</b>
    <br><br>
    <p id="para1">Pixel art is the art form of using pixels to create an image on a screen using individual coloured pixels. It has existed for nearly half a century, offically many agree that the first use of pixel art was around 1982, however many speculate it was created nearly a decade earlier.</p>
    <p id="para1">If we were to strech the definition of what exactly pixel art is it could go back even futher, mosaics are made in much the same way just with ceramic tiles instead</p>
<br><br>
    <b id="title1">Isnt pixel art old school?</b>
    <p id="para1">Not in the slightest!</p>
    <p id="para1">there are hundreds of conemporary examples of pixel art, one huge example is the wildly popular Minecraft, which even though it came out onto early access in 2010 (12 years ago!) still uses pixel art for all of its textures.</p>

    <b id="title1">Why should i use pixel art?</b>
    <p id="para1">Pixel art tends to be fairly easy to understand at lower resolutions (32bit,64bit) and unlike other traditional methods of art its fairly forgiving as well as incredibly easy to run the software required to actually make pixel art</p>
    <p id="para1">Not only that, but theres alot of room for error with traditional art, whereas with pixel art, every pixel is a defined size across all platforms, so its completely uniform while having plenty of room for creativity</p>
