    <br><br><br>
    <p id="para1">From a young age i was obsessed with games and how they interwove deep stories with fantastic art but constantly found myself to be more technical than artistic</p>
    <p id="para1">After finishing college i decided that i wanted to contribute back to the industry that had already given me so much, so i decided to become a game developer</p>
    <p id="para1"> However i found it hard to learn artistic techniques that were used in industry, so i started looking into more retro and other styleized techniques such as pixel art </p>
    <p id ="para1">I look forward to seeing this website change and grow as i become more experienced!</p>
